# Allergy Child
### Allergy Child? Not you again!

Allergy Child is back at it again. She is bored at home and wants to go over to her friend's house. The only problem is...she is allergic to everything! Okay, not everything, but a lot of things! The goal here is to safely get Ellie/AC to her friend's house. Some of her mortal enemies include: CATS, CATS, CATS! Also, Amoxicillin, dogs, and nuts. The things that help her are her inhaler, her nebulizer, and Cutie Pie (her trusty stuffed animal that gives her moral support). They give her life, if you will. Try to avoid her enemies (cats, amoxicillin, dogs, and nuts) while directing her to her friend's house. If you run into an enemy along the way, you will lose some of your health. Along the way, certain neighbors have inhalers she can use which will help gain your health back. Try to get Ellie to her friend's house alive, that way they are no longer bored!!

### MVP
- Create a game screen resembling a neighborhood
- Render a start screen with instructions and a start button
- Render game screen with player's health status
- Render a player that can move freely using WASD keys
- Render Ellie's home which acts as a safe zone
- Render the friend's house which, once arrived at, signifies that the player has won the game
- Render different obstacles that move around the canvas using setInterval, when player collides with them, a certain amount of health is lost
- Render health benefits (inhalers) that are removed from the canvas once Ellie collides with them and adds health back to the player


### Stretch Goals
- Possibly have a safe house where you can hide from incoming obstacles
- Create a health benefit (nebulizer, I know, hardcore) that gives extra health back to the player (more so than just an inhaler)
- Create another level? Who knows
